#this bot serves two functions.
#1.To tell someone the distance and time between two points using the google distance API. Simply say 'how far is it from "{city or place}" to "{city or place"'. The bot will then respond with the disatance in miles and time required to get there.

#2.To make requests to the Wiki API use the command "tell me about '[search term}'" The system will make a request to the WIKI api and return a paragraph of the term you searched. If the term is not in the data base it will return "I have no knowledge on this subject."
